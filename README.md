# ğŸ“‹ Attendance Tracking System in C

This is a simple **Attendance Tracking System** built using the C programming language. It reads student data from a CSV file (`students.csv`), allows attendance to be marked interactively via the terminal, and saves the updated records to `attendance.csv`.

## ğŸš€ Features

- Load student data from a CSV file
- View the list of students
- Mark students as present or absent by registration number
- View attendance summary (present vs absent count)
- Display individual student's attendance status
- Save attendance data to a new CSV file for future use

## ğŸ“‚ File Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ attendance.c        # Source code file
â”œâ”€â”€ students.csv        # Input file with student names and registration numbers
â””â”€â”€ attendance.csv      # Output file where attendance is recorded
